                      <p> Thanks for coming to my site. I'll explain a bit about myself, and then you can read some blog posts ive written.</p>
                    

                    <p> I'm a student at WashU in St. Louis. I'm currently a computer science and economics joint major, with a minor in psychology. I enjoy boxing, playing pickup and watching basketball. I love mwatching movies and TV shows, a show I recently just finished is Top Boy. I would like to work in the Tech industry after college and someday hope to start my own business, although I'm not sure what for yet.  </p>
