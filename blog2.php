                    <p> More info about myself! </p>

                    <p> I am a really big sneakerhead. I began reselling shoes in 8th grade as a way to make enough money to purchase the shoes that I wanted. This is where I began becoming a more business oriented person.
                         I also love animals, I have a pitbull named Gotti. In addition, I enjoy just being outside and not cooped up in the house. </p>
